# Loan-Amount-and-Duration-Prediction

There are two models here:

1.) To predict the loan amount using lightGBM. 
2.) To predict loan duration using logistic regression.

The reason these two models dont have an acceptable amount of accuracy is because the data is highy imbalanced and there was 
no further information provided.
